What I see as a graphics is
circles with a nice color tones with a simple color matched stroke


instead of using the numbers you will select colors.
thats gonna be much more interesting and challenging.
probably a better name of the game will be something like ColorDoku 

色独 - IroDoku as Google Translator was able to translate "color"

can consider a ColorBlind version so that everybody can play it.
Also it may check if the deaf-Function of the phone is activated and pronounce the colors.
It will be good if the google translator is used to pronounce the correct words in the user's language.

All the translations in the game might use the Google translations if the language is not specified.
Full game-translators might be given the right to use the paid version for free.
