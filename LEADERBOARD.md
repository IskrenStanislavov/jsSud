The idea is to have:

timing and quantity of solved puzzles.

for the server side we need to have the number of solved and wich puzzles are solved, and also given to the player
 - that is started/solved puzzles. how many hints are used.
 - points calculation system.
 - puzzles solved in less then lets say a minute will be blocking the account. or taking points rather than giving.
 	that is to prevent cheating.
 - maybe in orther to prevent cheating it will be better to use colors or shapes instead of numbers.
